            <p class="article__content">Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth — stepped back to note the effect — added a touch here and there — criticised the effect again — Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:</p>

            <blockquote class="article__highlight">"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."</blockquote>

            <p class="article__content">Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:</p>

                <figcaption class="cover-photo__caption">A tall wooden fence painted blue and yellow with a white folk pattern in the middle</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="article__content">No — no — I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence — right here on the street, you know — but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and she wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done.</p>

            <div class="article__note">
                <p class="article__note-text"></p>
            </div>

            <blockquote class="article__highlight">"I'll give you all of it!"</blockquote>

            <p class="article__content">He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while — plenty of company — and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.</p>

                <img src="dist/imgs/tom-02.jpg" alt="" class="article__note-img">
            </div>

            <p class="article__content">Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it</p>

            <p class="article__content"> If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement.</p>
