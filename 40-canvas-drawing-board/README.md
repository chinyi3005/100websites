## What did I learn from this project?

- Canvas HTML5 element 
Connect and create the path between two points then draw it out. The line is multicolor, and will increase and decrease in width.  

- Mouse events
Attach drawing functions for these events: `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mouseout`.  

- HSL color
I understand how it works, so powerful with javascript to control different colors independently.

- Download image
Get the data URL and save the entire canvas content.
