# Show the local weather

This is one of the intermediate projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather). I learn how to detect the location based on IP address, then generate weather reports and images for the next 3 days. I also make a pure CSS switch button to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
