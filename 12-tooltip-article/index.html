			<p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltip-keyword">Missouri</span><span class="tooltip-content clearfix"><img src="img/tom.jpg"><span class="tooltip-text"><strong>Missouri</strong>, is a state located in the Midwestern United States. It is the 21st most extensive, and the 18th most populous of the fifty states. The state comprises 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" target="_blank">- Wikipedia</a></span></span></span> worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents.
