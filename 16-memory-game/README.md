# Memory Game
The image match game is built using mostly javascript. With functions to shuffle the array of images, lay each of them out in the square grid, check if 2 cards have the same image, and show how many scores when players complete the game. 

###### 2 plugins I used on this practice

- [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) to create a flipping card animation.

- [SweetAlert2](https://limonte.github.io/sweetalert2/) to display a popup box after completing the game.
