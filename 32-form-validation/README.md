# Photo Editor with CSS Variables and JS

What I enjoyed this challenge is that I learned how to define and override of CSS `variables`, `filter` properties and update function of javascript to control the image's style. I executed the function to listen to updates on all input elements, then re-assign a CSS Variable on the document root with the same `name` as the `input`, and use the input's value as the CSS Variable's value.
